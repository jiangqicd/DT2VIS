# DT2VIS: A focus+context answer generation system to facilitate visual exploration of tabular data

This repository contains source code used for visual dialogue analysis system in the DT2VIS paper. Note that the code was tested with Python 3. Please python 3 as your test environment.

## Web Demo
For convenience, we provide a app (server/app.py) that runs the visual dialogue analysis system, DT2VIS. We also provide [DT2VIS's project website](http://dt2vis.godoorsun.org:45186/) and [DT2VIS's alternate website.](http://dt2vis2.godoorsun.org:45186/) Please clear the browser cache before using DT2VIS!

Overview of the online system is shown as follow.

The user interface of DT2VIS system includes five views. User can select analysis dataset and overview the dataset in data detail view. Query sentence is input in query input view. User can view the details of the answer in main view, and side answer view provides other alternative answers. Recommendation view provide the follow up query recommended, Query history view shoews the history of userâ€™s queries

## Introduction
DT2VIS takes a natural language query about a given dataset as input and outputs a focus+context answer, and conducts users to explore. The workflow of the system is as follow.

The query parsing engine parse the relevant information (e.g., attributes, filter, and task) from the input query during query collection through an input interface. Next, the system extracts specific data segments from the data space based on the attributes and filtered information, and answer generation templates corresponding to the task will also be collected. These data segments and templates will be transported to the answer generation engine to generate answers. The system utilizes a focus+context approach in the answer generation engine to generate text and visualization answers. Simultaneously, the task and attribute information parsed by the query parsing engine will also be sent to the query recommendation engine. The system first updates the transition matrix based on user feedback on the previously recommended query and then computes the recommended query from the new transition matrix. Finally, the answer and recommended queries will be replied to the user together. Users may have a new query intention and start a new round of query tasks.

## **Install Dependencies**
The DT2VIS code has a few dependencies that can be installed using the requirement.txt file,
In addition, the system also needs stanford-parser.jar and stanford-parser-models.jar.
