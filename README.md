# DT2VIS: A focus+context answer generation system to facilitate visual exploration of tabular data

This repository contains source code used for visual dialogue analysis system in the DT2VIS paper. Note that the code was tested with Python 3. Please python 3 as your test environment.

## Web Demo
For convenience, we provide a app (server/app.py) that runs the visual dialogue analysis system, DT2VIS. We also provide [DT2VIS's project website](http://dt2vis.godoorsun.org:45186/) and [DT2VIS's alternate website.](http://dt2vis2.godoorsun.org:45186/)  
Overview of the online system is shown as follow.
