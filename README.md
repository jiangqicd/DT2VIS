# DT2VIS: A focus+context answer generation system to facilitate visual exploration of tabular data

This repository contains source code used for visual dialogue analysis system in the DT2VIS paper. Note that the code was tested with Python 3. Please python 3 as your test environment.

## Introduction
DT2VIS takes a natural language query about a given dataset as input and outputs a focus+context answer, and conducts users to explore

## **Install Dependencies**
The DT2VIS code has a few dependencies that can be installed using the requirement.txt file,
In addition, the system also needs stanford-parser.jar and stanford-parser-models.jar.

## Web Demo
For convenience, we provide a app (server/app.py) that runs the visual dialogue analysis system, Data2vis. We also provide [DT2VIS's project website.](http://dt2vis.godoorsun.org:45186/)
